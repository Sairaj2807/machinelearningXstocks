# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict the next day's closing price of a stock using historical price data. The dataset is automatically fetched using the **Yahoo Finance API** (`yfinance`), and the model is trained using the `scikit-learn` library.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Fetch historical stock data via Yahoo Finance
- âœ… Train a linear regression model on past prices
- âœ… Predict the **next day's closing price**
- âœ… Visualize actual vs predicted closing prices

## ðŸ§  How It Works

This project assumes a simple relationship between a stockâ€™s current closing price and its next closing price. It:

1. Downloads stock data (default: `RELIANCE.NS`) using `yfinance`
2. Uses the current dayâ€™s closing price as a feature
3. Uses the **next dayâ€™s closing price** as the target
4. Trains a **Linear Regression** model
5. Predicts future price and plots results
