📊 Stock Market Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning (Linear Regression) to predict the next day's closing price of a stock using historical data. The data is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API, and the model is implemented in Python using scikit-learn.

🔧 Features
Fetches historical stock price data using yfinance

Trains a Linear Regression model on closing prices

Predicts the next day's closing price

Visualizes actual vs predicted prices with matplotlib
